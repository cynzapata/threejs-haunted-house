# Three.js Journey

I utulized Three.js, Node.js, Vercel, Javascript, HTML, and CSS to follow Bruno Simon's tutorial on building a haunted house with gravestones and ghosts. I practiced loading textures, gui controls, lights, making objects, and adding shadows to the scene.

It can be seen on: https://threejs-haunted-house-gamma.vercel.app/

or if you have a vercel account on: https://vercel.com/cynzapata/threejs-haunted-house

## Setup
Download [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
Run this followed commands:

``` bash
# Install dependencies (only the first time)
npm install

# Run the local server at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# Build for production in the dist/ directory
npm run build
```
